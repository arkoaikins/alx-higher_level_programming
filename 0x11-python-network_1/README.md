### Requirements for the tasks
- Used the vi editor
- files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3(version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- First line of files is `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Codes are compliant with pycodestyle(version 2.8)
- All files are executable
- All modules have documentations `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- I used `get` to acess dictionary value by key(this won't throw an exception if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary)
- All codes can not be executed when imported, i used `if __name__ == "__main__":`
